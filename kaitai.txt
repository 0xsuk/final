use crate_pdb.ksy(taken from crate-digger) to generate rekordbox_pdb.cpp and .h, because pdb.ksy from mixxx is outdated(endianness is wrong)
change std::string("utf16be") to "utf16be"

use mixxx_anlz.ksy(taken from mixxx) to generate rekordbox_anlz.cpp and .h because anlz.ksy from crate-digger is only for java.
