`finyl.c, finyl.h`: minimal audio mixing library that provides a core mechanism to handle DJ operation (audio playback with bpm adjustment/sync, loop, beat snap, etc). Depends on `ALSA, ffmpeg(cli)`.


The finyl software is a linux application that implements GUI interface and audio playback controls on top of finyl library. Depends on `sdl2 x11 openssl`
