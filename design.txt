- open source dj system
- for realtime/ahead-of-time stem separeted (vocal and instrument for each track, for now. drums coming?) audio mixing.
- independent to a choice of stem separation tool
- portable. works on rasberry pi.
- works with Rekordbox-exported USB
- NO time-stretching (change bpm without changing pitch)
- NO bpm hard sync (one deck follow the bpm change of the other), just a one-time bpm alignment
- `quantize` operation timing
- 
-idea: client/server architecture. Works independenty to GUI client. but provides default GUI

- use 2 mono to stereo cables
  - mixed audio for headphone cue from one channel -> use stereo cable
  - mixed audio for speaker from another channel -> use stereo cable
  - computationally expensive
  - no true stereo
  - two track from one channel, headphone from other channel
  
(alternate choice might be
- use audio mixer for
  - controlling volume of each deck.
  - headphone cueing: headphone cueing without audio mixer means PC have to stream raw audio for headphone and volumed audio for speaker. PC is basically has only two channel headphone jack, so each audio (raw and volumed) has to be mono.
  - one track from one channel, other track from other channel
